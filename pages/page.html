                Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, 
                the largest planet in the solar system – more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.
                Jupiter's stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium.

                Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter. 
                It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine-and-a-half times that of Earth. 
                It has only one-eighth the average density of Earth, but is over 95 times more massive
